  Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;  And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:  His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found%2c  In every art of glorious war renown'd;  In the same car the chiefs to combat ride%2c  And fought united%2c and united died.  Struck at the sight%2c the mighty Ajax glows  With thirst of vengeance%2c and assaults the foes.

Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung%2c  And fierce%2c to seize it%2c conquering Ajax sprung;  Around his head an iron tempest rain'd;  A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd:  Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd%2c  And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:  He could no more; the showering darts denied  To spoil his glittering arms%2c and plumy pride.  Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields%2c  With bristling lances%2c and compacted shields;  Till in the steely circle straiten'd round%2c  Forced he gives way%2c and sternly quits the ground.,The Iliad by Homer

Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many hisstrange and dangerous charm.  His great wealth was a certain element ofsecurity.  Society--civilized society%2c at least--is never very ready tobelieve anything to the detriment of those who are both rich andfascinating.  It feels instinctively that manners are of moreimportance than morals%2c and%2c in its opinion%2c the highest respectabilityis of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.  And%2c afterall%2c it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who hasgiven one a bad dinner%2c or poor wine%2c is irreproachable in his privatelife.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_%2c asLord Henry remarked once%2c in a discussion on the subject%2c and there ispossibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the canons of goodsociety are%2c or should be%2c the same as the canons of art.  Form isabsolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity of a ceremony%2cas well as its unreality%2c and should combine the insincere character ofa romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightfulto us.  Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It ismerely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.,The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

The worship of the senses has often%2c and with much justice%2c beendecried%2c men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions andsensations that seem stronger than themselves%2c and that they areconscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses hadnever been understood%2c and that they had remained savage and animalmerely because the world had sought to starve them into submission orto kill them by pain%2c instead of aiming at making them elements of anew spirituality%2c of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be thedominant characteristic.  As he looked back upon man moving throughhistory%2c he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So much had beensurrendered! and to such little purpose!  There had been mad wilfulrejections%2c monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial%2c whoseorigin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely moreterrible than that fancied degradation from which%2c in their ignorance%2cthey had sought to escape; Nature%2c in her wonderful irony%2c driving outthe anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving tothe hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.,The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:  His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame  That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:  Dire as the monster%2c dreadful as the god!

After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain beingunhooked.  The door opened quietly%2c and he went in without saying aword to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into theshadow as he passed.  At the end of the hall hung a tattered greencurtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed himin from the street.  He dragged it aside and entered a long low roomwhich looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrillflaring gas-jets%2c dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors thatfaced them%2c were ranged round the walls.  Greasy reflectors of ribbedtin backed them%2c making quivering disks of light.

This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in theScripture and our author.

We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find noauthor has ever drawn so many%2c with so visible and surprising a variety%2cor given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one hassomething so singularly his own%2c that no painter could have distinguishedthem more by their features%2c than the poet has by their manners. Nothingcan be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the differentdegrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfullydiversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles isfurious and intractable; that of Diomede forward%2c yet listening to advice%2cand subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; ofHector%2c active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited bylove of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness andtenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; inSarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishingdiversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes themain of each character%2c but even in the under parts of it%2c to which hetakes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the maincharacters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinctin this%2c that the wisdom of one is artificial and various%2c of the othernatural%2c open%2c and regular. But they have%2c besides%2c characters of courage;and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the differenceof his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution%2c the otherupon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds.The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner;they lie%2c in a great degree%2c hidden and undistinguished; and%2c where theyare marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer.His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no waypeculiar%2c but%2c as it is%2c in a superior degree; and we see nothing thatdifferences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus%2c Cloanthus%2c orthe rest%2c In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes%2c that anair of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savagecourage appears in his Capaneus%2c Tydeus%2c Hippomedon%2c &c. They have aparity of character%2c which makes them seem brothers of one family. Ibelieve when the reader is led into this tract of reflection%2c if he willpursue it through the epic and tragic writers%2c he will be convinced howinfinitely superior%2c in this point%2c the invention of Homer was to that ofall others.,The Iliad by Homer

To throw his language more out of prose%2c Homer seems to have affected thecompound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper topoetry%2c not only as it heightened the diction%2c but as it assisted andfilled the numbers with greater sound and pomp%2c and likewise conduced insome measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannotbut attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention%2c since (ashe has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of thepersons or things to which they were joined. We see the motion of Hector'splumes in the epithet Korythaiolos%2c the landscape of Mount Neritus in thatof Einosiphyllos%2c and so of others%2c which particular images could not havebeen insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though butof a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principalaction or figure.

It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent inour language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain noliteral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superiorlanguage: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that arash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no lessin danger to lose the spirit of an ancient%2c by deviating into the modernmanners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness%2c there is often alight in antiquity%2c which nothing better preserves than a version almostliteral. I know no liberties one ought to take%2c but those which arenecessary to transfusing the spirit of the original%2c and supporting thepoetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say%2c there havenot been more men misled in former times by a servile%2c dull adherence tothe letter%2c than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical%2c insolent hopeof raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted%2c that thefire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard%2c as it ismost likely to expire in his managing: however%2c it is his safest way to becontent with preserving this to his utmost in the whole%2c withoutendeavouring to be more than he finds his author is%2c in any particularplace. It is a great secret in writing%2c to know when to be plain%2c and whenpoetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us%2c if we willbut follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty%2clet us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble%2c weought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring thecensure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems tohave been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some ofhis translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of thesublime; others sunk into flatness%2c in a cold and timorous notion ofsimplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer%2c somesweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certainsigns of false mettle)%2c others slowly and servilely creeping in his train%2cwhile the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected andequal majesty before them. However%2c of the two extremes one could soonerpardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for suchcommendations%2c as he may gain by that character of style%2c which hisfriends must agree together to call simplicity%2c and the rest of the worldwill call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity%2c as wellas a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the airof a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up%2cand another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean betweenostentation and rusticity.,The Iliad by Homer

He was an extremely clever young man%2c though he had no realappreciation of the visible arts%2c and whatever little sense of thebeauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.

This play was good enough for us%2c Harry.  It was Romeo and Juliet.  Imust admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespearedone in such a wretched hole of a place.  Still%2c I felt interested%2c ina sort of way.  At any rate%2c I determined to wait for the first act.There was a dreadful orchestra%2c presided over by a young Hebrew who satat a cracked piano%2c that nearly drove me away%2c but at last thedrop-scene was drawn up and the play began.  Romeo was a stout elderlygentleman%2c with corked eyebrows%2c a husky tragedy voice%2c and a figurelike a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad.  He was played by thelow-comedian%2c who had introduced gags of his own and was on mostfriendly terms with the pit.  They were both as grotesque as thescenery%2c and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. ButJuliet!  Harry%2c imagine a girl%2c hardly seventeen years of age%2c with alittle%2c flowerlike face%2c a small Greek head with plaited coils ofdark-brown hair%2c eyes that were violet wells of passion%2c lips that werelike the petals of a rose.  She was the loveliest thing I had ever seenin my life.  You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved%2c but thatbeauty%2c mere beauty%2c could fill your eyes with tears.  I tell you%2cHarry%2c I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that cameacross me.  And her voice--I never heard such a voice.  It was very lowat first%2c with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one'sear.  Then it became a little louder%2c and sounded like a flute or adistant hautboy.  In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasythat one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.  Therewere moments%2c later on%2c when it had the wild passion of violins.  Youknow how a voice can stir one.  Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vaneare two things that I shall never forget.  When I close my eyes%2c I hearthem%2c and each of them says something different.  I don't know which tofollow.  Why should I not love her?  Harry%2c I do love her.  She iseverything to me in life.  Night after night I go to see her play.  Oneevening she is Rosalind%2c and the next evening she is Imogen.  I haveseen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb%2c sucking the poison fromher lover's lips.  I have watched her wandering through the forest ofArden%2c disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.She has been mad%2c and has come into the presence of a guilty king%2c andgiven him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of.  She has beeninnocent%2c and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlikethroat.  I have seen her in every age and in every costume.  Ordinarywomen never appeal to one's imagination.  They are limited to theircentury.  No glamour ever transfigures them.  One knows their minds aseasily as one knows their bonnets.  One can always find them.  There isno mystery in any of them.  They ride in the park in the morning andchatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.  They have their stereotypedsmile and their fashionable manner.  They are quite obvious.  But anactress!

As for Homer's repetitions%2c we may divide them into three sorts: of wholenarrations and speeches%2c of single sentences%2c and of one verse orhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these%2c asneither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand%2c nor tooffend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungracefulin those speeches%2c where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort ofinsolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men%2c or fromhigher powers to inferiors in concerns of state%2c or where the ceremonialof religion seems to require it%2c in the solemn forms of prayers%2c oaths%2c orthe like. In other cases%2c I believe the best rule is%2c to be guided by thenearness%2c or distance%2c at which the repetitions are placed in theoriginal: when they follow too close%2c one may vary the expression; but itis a question%2c whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any:if they be tedious%2c the author is to answer for it.,The Iliad by Homer

It is owing to the same vast invention%2c that his similes have been thoughttoo exuberant and full of circumstances.

His similes are like pictures%2c where theprincipal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to theoriginal%2c but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects.

Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as aliterary novelty. Justus Lipsius%2c a scholar of no ordinary skill%2c seems torevel in the imaginary discovery%2c that the tragedies attributed to Senecaare by _four_ different authors.(34) Now%2c I will venture to assert%2c thatthese tragedies are so uniform%2c not only in their borrowed phraseology--aphraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus weremore charmed than ourselves--in their freedom from real poetry%2c and last%2cbut not least%2c in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of goodtaste%2c that few writers of the present day would question the capabilitiesof the same gentleman%2c be he Seneca or not%2c to produce not only these%2c buta great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity%2c Father Hardouinastonished the world with the startling announcement that the Ćneid ofVirgil%2c and the satires of Horace%2c were literary deceptions. Now%2c withoutwishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry andlearning--nay%2c the refined acuteness--which scholars%2c like Wolf%2c havebestowed upon this subject%2c I must express my fears%2c that many of ourmodern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise andentertainment%2c rather than the instruction%2c of posterity.

What other cavils have been raised against Homer%2c are such as hardlydeserve a reply%2c but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in thecourse of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavourto exalt Virgil; which is much the same%2c as if one should think to raisethe superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine%2c bythe whole course of their parallels%2c that these critics never so much asheard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoevercompares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse himfor the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as whenthey prefer the fable and moral of the Ćneis to those of the Iliad%2c forthe same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the Ćneis; as that thehero is a wiser man%2c and the action of the one more beneficial to hiscountry than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing whathe never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a princeas Ćneas%2c when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Othersselect those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured assome that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management ofScaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low andmean expressions%2c sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement%2coftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original%2c and then triumphin the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct ofPerrault in his Parallels. Lastly%2c there are others%2c who%2c pretending to afairer proceeding%2c distinguish between the personal merit of Homer%2c andthat of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the greatreputation of the Iliad%2c they found it upon the ignorance of his times%2cand the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of thisprinciple%2c they make those accidents (such as the contention of thecities%2c &c.) to be the causes of his fame%2c which were in reality theconsequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil%2c orany great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casualadditions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; whoyet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived%2c he musthave been the greatest poet of his nation%2c and that he may be said in hissense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.(39),The Iliad by Homer

During dinner%2c Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn%2c he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest%2c and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine%2c by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.

"The dogs%2c instead of eating%2c kept barking at the stranger%2c according totheir usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus%2c myfriend%2c prythee attend to my behest.

Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer%2c what principally strikes us ishis invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of hiswork; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive andcopious than any other%2c his manners more lively and strongly marked%2c hisspeeches more affecting and transported%2c his sentiments more warm andsublime%2c his images and descriptions more full and animated%2c hisexpression more raised and daring%2c and his numbers more rapid and various.I hope%2c in what has been said of Virgil%2c with regard to any of theseheads%2c I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurdor endless%2c than the common method of comparing eminent writers by anopposition of particular passages in them%2c and forming a judgment fromthence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledgeof the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is inthat we are to consider him%2c and in proportion to his degree in that weare to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in morethan one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention%2c Virgil has injudgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment%2c becauseVirgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention%2cbecause Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authorshad more of both than perhaps any man besides%2c and are only said to haveless in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius%2c Virgilthe better artist. In one we most admire the man%2c in the other the work.Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgilleads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generousprofusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer%2c like theNile%2c pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil%2c like a riverin its banks%2c with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold theirbattles%2c methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. Homer%2cboundless and resistless as Achilles%2c bears all before him%2c and shinesmore and more as the tumult increases; Virgil%2c calmly daring%2c like Ćneas%2cappears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him%2cand conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines%2cHomer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors%2c shaking Olympus%2cscattering the lightnings%2c and firing the heavens: Virgil%2c like the samepower in his benevolence%2c counselling with the gods%2c laying plans forempires%2c and regularly ordering his whole creation.,The Iliad by Homer

At what period%2c continues Grote%2c "these poems%2c or indeed any other Greekpoems%2c first began to be written%2c must be matter of conjecture%2c thoughthere is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon. If%2c inthe absence of evidence%2c we may venture upon naming any more determinateperiod%2c the question a once suggests itself%2c What were the purposes which%2cin that state of society%2c a manuscript at its first commencement must havebeen intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not forthe rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory%2c butalso interwoven with the feelings%2c and conceived in conjunction with allthose flexions and intonations of voice%2c pauses%2c and other oral artificeswhich were required for emphatic delivery%2c and which the naked manuscriptcould never reproduce. Not for the general public--they were accustomed toreceive it with its rhapsodic delivery%2c and with its accompaniments of asolemn and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliadwould be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a classof readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they hadexperienced as hearers in the crowd%2c and who would%2c on perusing thewritten words%2c realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of theimpression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement mayseem in an age like the present%2c there is in all early societies%2c andthere was in early Greece%2c a time when no such reading class existed. Ifwe could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed%2c weshould be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems werefirst committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatestprobability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even ofthe narrowest reading class in Greece%2c is the middle of the seventhcentury before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630)%2c the age ofTerpander%2c Kallinus%2c Archilochus%2c Simonides of Amorgus%2c &c. I ground thissupposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies ofGrecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having beenintroduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter%2c and poetical compositionshaving been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present andreal life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the onlyknown mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable%2cyet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of lookingat the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for newpoetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it%2c may well beconsidered as desirous to study%2c and competent to criticize%2c from theirown individual point of view%2c the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies%2cjust as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebaisas the production of Homer. There seems%2c therefore%2c ground forconjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important%2c butvery narrow class)%2c manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other oldepics%2c--the Thebais and the Cypria%2c as well as the Iliad and theOdyssey%2c--began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century(B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce%2c which took placeabout the same period%2c would furnish increased facilities for obtainingthe requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class%2c when once formed%2cwould doubtless slowly increase%2c and the number of manuscripts along withit; so that before the time of Solon%2c fifty years afterwards%2c both readersand manuscripts%2c though still comparatively few%2c might have attained acertain recognized authority%2c and formed a tribunal of reference againstthe carelessness of individual rhapsodes."(26),The Iliad by Homer

Upon the whole%2c I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justiceto Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertainwithout much vanity%2c of giving a more tolerable copy of him than anyentire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman%2cHobbes%2c and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurablelength of verse%2c notwithstanding which%2c there is scarce any paraphrasemore loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of fouror six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey%2cver. 312%2c where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistakenin so bold a manner%2c that one might think he deviated on purpose%2c if hedid not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles.He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings outof his author; insomuch as to promise%2c in his rhyming preface%2c a poem ofthe mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured tostrain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved infustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings%2c asin the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise%2c &c. In a word%2c the nature of the manmay account for his whole performance; for he appears%2c from his prefaceand remarks%2c to have been of an arrogant turn%2c and an enthusiast inpoetry.

He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute ascience that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.  As itwas%2c we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name men gave totheir mistakes.  Moralists had%2c as a rule%2c regarded it as a mode ofwarning%2c had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formationof character%2c had praised it as something that taught us what to followand showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive power inexperience.  It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the sameas our past%2c and that the sin we had done once%2c and with loathing%2c wewould do many times%2c and with joy.,The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

It is unfortunate for us%2c that%2c of some of the greatest men%2c we knowleast%2c and talk most. Homer%2c Socrates%2c and Shakespere(1) have%2c perhaps%2ccontributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than anyother three writers who could be named%2c and yet the history of all threehas given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion%2c which has left uslittle save the option of choosing which theory or theories we willfollow. The personality of Shakespere is%2c perhaps%2c the only thing in whichcritics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everythingelse%2c even down to the authorship of plays%2c there is more or less of doubtand uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions ofPlato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the _dramatispersonae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears asthe enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of thewriters who have handed them down. When we have read Plato _or_ Xenophon%2cwe think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read andexamined both%2c we feel convinced that we are something worse thanignorant.,The Iliad by Homer

Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative%2c and aware asI must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief%2c itstill seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for ahigher criticism than it has often obtained.

Were faith novirtue%2c then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on anymatter. But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems asthough our faith should be especially tried touching the men and theevents which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity.And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great andthe good%2c which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which wouldallegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue%2c and measure thegiants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.,The Iliad by Homer

And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in whichprogress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice%2c and in whichpersons and things are%2c day by day%2c finding their real level%2c in lieu oftheir conventional value. The same principles which have swept awaytraditional abuses%2c and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues ofsinecurists%2c and stripping the thin%2c tawdry veil from attractivesuperstitions%2c are working as actively in literature as in society. Thecredulity of one writer%2c or the partiality of another%2c finds as powerful atouchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of atemperate class of antagonists%2c as the dreams of conservatism%2c or theimpostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition%2cwhether of ancient or comparatively recent times%2c are subjected to verydifferent handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of formerages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched%2c and the motivesof the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of hishistory%2c as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful andtroublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a largeportion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no lesspertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief%2c to write a history%2c wemust know more than mere facts. Human nature%2c viewed under an induction ofextended experience%2c is the best help to the criticism of human history.Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which humanexperience%2c whether actual or traditionary%2c has furnished. To form correctviews of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a greatwhole--we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whomthey are surrounded%2c and%2c in contemplating the incidents in their lives orcondition which tradition has handed down to us%2c we must rather considerthe general bearing of the whole narrative%2c than the respectiveprobability of its details.,The Iliad by Homer

Lastly%2c if we consider his versification%2c we shall be sensible what ashare of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfiedwith his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece%2c butsearched through its different dialects with this particular view%2c tobeautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greatermixture of vowels or consonants%2c and accordingly employed them as theverse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he mostaffected was the Ionic%2c which has a peculiar sweetness%2c from its neverusing contractions%2c and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs intotwo syllables%2c so as to make the words open themselves with a morespreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the Atticcontractions%2c the broader Doric%2c and the feebler Ćolic%2c which oftenrejects its aspirate%2c or takes off its accent%2c and completed this varietyby altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus his measures%2cinstead of being fetters to his sense%2c were always in readiness to runalong with the warmth of his rapture%2c and even to give a furtherrepresentation of his notions%2c in the correspondence of their sounds towhat they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony whichmakes us confess he had not only the richest head%2c but the finest ear inthe world. This is so great a truth%2c that whoever will but consult thetune of his verses%2c even without understanding them (with the same sort ofdiligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas)%2c willfind more sweetness%2c variety%2c and majesty of sound%2c than in any otherlanguage of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics tobe copied but faintly by Virgil himself%2c though they are so just as toascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has someadvantages both from the natural sound of its words%2c and the turn andcadence of its verse%2c which agree with the genius of no other language.Virgil was very sensible of this%2c and used the utmost diligence in workingup a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of%2cand%2c in particular%2c never failed to bring the sound of his line to abeautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been sofrequently celebrated on this account as the Roman%2c the only reason is%2cthat fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysiusof Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in thiskind%2c in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices at presentto observe of his numbers%2c that they flow with so much ease%2c as to makeone imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as theMuses dictated%2c and%2c at the same time%2c with so much force and inspiritingvigour%2c that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. Theyroll along as a plentiful river%2c always in motion%2c and always full; whilewe are borne away by a tide of verse%2c the most rapid%2c and yet the mostsmooth imaginable.,The Iliad by Homer

In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to thehonour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed thecharacteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers%2c hestill continues superior to them.

They must interest you%2c Dorian.  Every gentleman is interested in hisgood name.  You don't want people to talk of you as something vile anddegraded.  Of course%2c you have your position%2c and your wealth%2c and allthat kind of thing.  But position and wealth are not everything.  Mindyou%2c I don't believe these rumours at all.  At least%2c I can't believethem when I see you.  Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man'sface.  It cannot be concealed.  People talk sometimes of secret vices.There are no such things.  If a wretched man has a vice%2c it showsitself in the lines of his mouth%2c the droop of his eyelids%2c themoulding of his hands even.  Somebody--I won't mention his name%2c butyou know him--came to me last year to have his portrait done.  I hadnever seen him before%2c and had never heard anything about him at thetime%2c though I have heard a good deal since.  He offered an extravagantprice.  I refused him.  There was something in the shape of his fingersthat I hated.  I know now that I was quite right in what I fanciedabout him.  His life is dreadful.  But you%2c Dorian%2c with your pure%2cbright%2c innocent face%2c and your marvellous untroubled youth--I can'tbelieve anything against you.  And yet I see you very seldom%2c and younever come down to the studio now%2c and when I am away from you%2c and Ihear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you%2c Idon't know what to say.  Why is it%2c Dorian%2c that a man like the Duke ofBerwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it?  Why is it that somany gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you totheirs?  You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley.  I met him at dinnerlast week.  Your name happened to come up in conversation%2c inconnection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at theDudley.  Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the mostartistic tastes%2c but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girlshould be allowed to know%2c and whom no chaste woman should sit in thesame room with.  I reminded him that I was a friend of yours%2c and askedhim what he meant.  He told me.  He told me right out before everybody.It was horrible!  Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?  Therewas that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.  You werehis great friend.  There was Sir Henry Ashton%2c who had to leave Englandwith a tarnished name.  You and he were inseparable.  What about AdrianSingleton and his dreadful end?  What about Lord Kent's only son andhis career?  I met his father yesterday in St. James's Street.  Heseemed broken with shame and sorrow.

If we descend from hence to the expression%2c we see the bright imaginationof Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge himthe father of poetical diction; the first who taught that "language of thegods" to men. His expression is like the colouring of some great masters%2cwhich discovers itself to be laid on boldly%2c and executed with rapidity.It is%2c indeed%2c the strongest and most glowing imaginable%2c and touched withthe greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say%2c he was the only poet whohad found out "living words;" there are in him more daring figures andmetaphors than in any good author whatever. An arrow is "impatient" to beon the wing%2c a weapon "thirsts" to drink the blood of an enemy%2c and thelike%2c yet his expression is never too big for the sense%2c but justly greatin proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out thediction%2c which rises with it%2c and forms itself about it%2c for in the samedegree that a thought is warmer%2c an expression will be brighter%2c as thatis more strong%2c this will become more perspicuous; like glass in thefurnace%2c which grows to a greater magnitude%2c and refines to a greaterclearness%2c only as the breath within is more powerful%2c and the heat moreintense.,The Iliad by Homer

To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed%2c that Wolf'sobjections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have neverbeen wholly got over%2c we cannot help discovering that they have failed toenlighten us as to any substantial point%2c and that the difficulties withwhich the whole subject is beset%2c are rather augmented than otherwise%2c ifwe admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's(28) modification of his theoryany better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad intosixteen different songs%2c and treats as ridiculous the belief that theiramalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than theage of Peisistratus. This%2c as Grote observes%2c "explains the gaps andcontradictions in the narrative%2c but it explains nothing else." Moreover%2cwe find no contradictions warranting this belief%2c and the so-calledsixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in thefirst battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor%2c chief of theEuboeans; Tlepolemus%2c of the Rhodians; Pandarus%2c of the Lycians; Odius%2c ofthe Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas%2c of the Thracians. None of these heroesagain make their appearance%2c and we can but agree with Colonel Mure%2c that"it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have soharmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel."

  To sacred Troy%2c where all her princes lay  To wait the event%2c the herald bent his way.  He came%2c and standing in the midst%2c explain'd  The peace rejected%2c but the truce obtain'd.  Straight to their several cares the Trojans move%2c  Some search the plains%2c some fell the sounding grove:  Nor less the Greeks%2c descending on the shore%2c  Hew'd the green forests%2c and the bodies bore.  And now from forth the chambers of the main%2c  To shed his sacred light on earth again%2c  Arose the golden chariot of the day%2c  And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.  In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train  Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.  Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore%2c  With dust dishonour'd%2c and deformed with gore.  The wounds they wash'd%2c their pious tears they shed%2c  And%2c laid along their cars%2c deplored the dead.  Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste  The bodies decent on the piles were placed:  With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd%2c  And%2c sadly slow%2c to sacred Troy return'd.  Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed%2c  And decent on the pile dispose the dead;  The cold remains consume with equal care;  And slowly%2c sadly%2c to their fleet repair.  Now%2c ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light  The doubtful confines of the day and night%2c  About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd%2c  And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.  Then%2c to secure the camp and naval powers%2c  They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:(186)  From space to space were ample gates around%2c  For passing chariots%2c and a trench profound  Of large extent; and deep in earth below%2c  Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.,The Iliad by Homer

Fable may be divided into the probable%2c the allegorical%2c and themarvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as%2c thoughthey did not happen%2c yet might%2c in the common course of nature; or of suchas%2c though they did%2c became fables by the additional episodes and mannerof telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem%2c "Thereturn of Ulysses%2c the settlement of the Trojans in Italy%2c" or the like.That of the Iliad is the "anger of Achilles%2c" the most short and singlesubject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with avaster variety of incidents and events%2c and crowded with a greater numberof councils%2c speeches%2c battles%2c and episodes of all kinds%2c than are to befound even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude andirregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit%2c andits whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil%2c for want ofso warm a genius%2c aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject%2c aswell as a greater length of time%2c and contracting the design of bothHomer's poems into one%2c which is yet but a fourth part as large as his.The other epic poets have used the same practice%2c but generally carried itso far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables%2c destroy the unity ofaction%2c and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor isit only in the main design that they have been unable to add to hisinvention%2c but they have followed him in every episode and part of story.If he has given a regular catalogue of an army%2c they all draw up theirforces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus%2c Virgilhas the same for Anchises%2c and Statius (rather than omit them) destroysthe unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit theshades%2c the Ćneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If hebe detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso%2c so is Ćneas byDido%2c and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on thescore of a quarrel through half the poem%2c Rinaldo must absent himself justas long on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestialarmour%2c Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has notonly observed this close imitation of Homer%2c but%2c where he had not led theway%2c supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon%2cand the taking of Troy%2c was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for wordfrom Pisander%2c as the loves of Dido and Ćneas are taken from those ofMedea and Jason in Apollonius%2c and several others in the same manner.,The Iliad by Homer

It is an interesting question%2c said Lord Henry%2c who found anexquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism%2c "anextremely interesting question.  I fancy that the true explanation isthis:  It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in suchan inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence%2c theirabsolute incoherence%2c their absurd want of meaning%2c their entire lackof style.  They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.

If these elements of beauty are real%2c thewhole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  Suddenlywe find that we are no longer the actors%2c but the spectators of theplay.  Or rather we are both.  We watch ourselves%2c and the mere wonderof the spectacle enthralls us.  In the present case%2c what is it thathas really happened?

That which%2c in my opinion%2c ought to be the endeavour of any one whotranslates Homer%2c is above all things to keep alive that spirit and firewhich makes his chief character: in particular places%2c where the sense canbear any doubt%2c to follow the strongest and most poetical%2c as mostagreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of hisstyle%2c and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve%2c in themore active or descriptive parts%2c a warmth and elevation; in the moresedate or narrative%2c a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches%2c a fulnessand perspicuity; in the sentences%2c a shortness and gravity; not to neglecteven the little figures and turns on the words%2c nor sometimes the verycast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs ofantiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compassthan has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preservedeither the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to him is%2c tostudy his author rather from his own text%2c than from any commentaries%2c howlearned soever%2c or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of theworld; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all theancients%2c and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these%2c theArchbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of thespirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the EpicPoem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all%2c withwhatever judgment and study a man may proceed%2c or with whatever happinesshe may perform such a work%2c he must hope to please but a few; those onlywho have at once a taste of poetry%2c and competent learning.

Some that cannot be so turned%2c as to preserve their full image by one ortwo words%2c may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epitheteinosiphyllos to a mountain%2c would appear little or ridiculous translatedliterally "leaf-shaking%2c" but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis:"the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods." Others that admit ofdifferent significations%2c may receive an advantage from a judiciousvariation%2c according to the occasions on which they are introduced.

Three parts of the emendations made uponpoets are mere alterations%2c some of which%2c had they been suggested to theauthor by his Maecenas or Africanus%2c he would probably have adopted.Moreover%2c those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbalcriticism and interpretation%2c are often least competent to carry out theirown precepts. Grammarians are not poets by profession%2c but may be so _peraccidens._ I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer%2ccalculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage%2c although amass of remarks%2c from Herodotus down to Loewe%2c have given us the historyof a thousand minute points%2c without which our Greek knowledge would begloomy and jejune.,The Iliad by Homer

This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of thesame epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the "far-darting Phoebus%2c"the "blue-eyed Pallas%2c" the "swift-footed Achilles%2c" &c.%2c which some havecensured as impertinent%2c and tediously repeated.

As for the epithets of great men%2c Mons. Boileau is ofopinion%2c that they were in the nature of surnames%2c and repeated as such;for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers%2c were obliged toadd some other distinction of each person; either naming his parentsexpressly%2c or his place of birth%2c profession%2c or the like: as Alexanderthe son of Philip%2c Herodotus of Halicarnassus%2c Diogenes the Cynic%2c &c.Homer%2c therefore%2c complying with the custom of his country%2c used suchdistinctive additions as better agreed with poetry.

"Half a century ago%2c the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf%2cturning to account the Venetian Scholia%2c which had then been recentlypublished%2c first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of theHomeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no meansthe whole) is employed in vindicating the position%2c previously announcedby Bentley%2c amongst others%2c that the separate constituent portions of theIliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body andunchangeable order%2c until the days of Peisistratus%2c in the sixth centurybefore Christ. As a step towards that conclusion%2c Wolf maintained that nowritten copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during theearlier times%2c to which their composition is referred; and that withoutwriting%2c neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could havebeen originally conceived by any poet%2c nor%2c if realized by him%2ctransmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy andconvenient writing%2c such as must be indispensably supposed for longmanuscripts%2c among the early Greeks%2c was thus one of the points in Wolf'scase against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch%2cand other leading opponents of Wolf%2c the connection of the one with theother seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has beenconsidered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate characterof the Iliad and Odyssey%2c to maintain that they were written poems fromthe beginning.
To me it appears%2c that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf toPeisistratus and his associates%2c in reference to the Homeric poems%2c arenowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that viewof the question%2c if it could be shown%2c that%2c in order to controvert it%2c wewere driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems%2c in the ninthcentury before the Christian aera. Few things%2c in my opinion%2c can be moreimprobable; and Mr. Payne Knight%2c opposed as he is to the Wolfianhypothesis%2c admits this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writingin Greece%2c even in the seventh century before the Christian aera%2c areexceedingly trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than thefortieth Olympiad%2c and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfullyexecuted; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus%2c Simonidesof Amorgus%2c Kallinus%2c Tyrtaeus%2c Xanthus%2c and the other early elegiac andlyric poets%2c committed their compositions to writing%2c or at what time thepractice of doing so became familiar.

  As on some mountain%2c through the lofty grove%2c  The crackling flames ascend%2c and blaze above;  The fires expanding%2c as the winds arise%2c  Shoot their long beams%2c and kindle half the skies:  So from the polish'd arms%2c and brazen shields%2c  A gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.

If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect ornarrowness of genius%2c than an excess of it%2c those seeming defects will befound upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times helived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods; and thevicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a wordof the latter%2c as it is a point generally carried into extremes%2c both bythe censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality toantiquity%2c to think with Madame Dacier%2c(38) "that those times and mannersare so much the more excellent%2c as they are more contrary to ours." Whocan be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of thoseages%2c when a spirit of revenge and cruelty%2c joined with the practice ofrapine and robbery%2c reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown butfor the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword%2cand their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the otherside%2c I would not be so delicate as those modern critics%2c who are shockedat the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see theheroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of thatsimplicity%2c in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholdingmonarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks%2c andprincesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer%2c we ought toreflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world;and those who consider him in this light%2c will double their pleasure inthe perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted withnations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almostthree thousand years back into the remotest antiquity%2c and entertainingthemselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to befound%2c the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alonetheir greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates theirdislike%2c will become a satisfaction.,The Iliad by Homer

Such%2c at any rate%2c was Dorian Gray's opinion.  He used to wonder at theshallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thingsimple%2c permanent%2c reliable%2c and of one essence.  To him%2c man was abeing with myriad lives and myriad sensations%2c a complex multiformcreature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought andpassion%2c and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladiesof the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-galleryof his country house and look at the various portraits of those whoseblood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip Herbert%2c described byFrancis Osborne%2c in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth andKing James%2c as one who was "caressed by the Court for his handsomeface%2c which kept him not long company."  Was it young Herbert's lifethat he sometimes led?  Had some strange poisonous germ crept from bodyto body till it had reached his own?  Was it some dim sense of thatruined grace that had made him so suddenly%2c and almost without cause%2cgive utterance%2c in Basil Hallward's studio%2c to the mad prayer that hadso changed his life?  Here%2c in gold-embroidered red doublet%2c jewelledsurcoat%2c and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands%2c stood Sir Anthony Sherard%2cwith his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.  What had thisman's legacy been?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed himsome inheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely thedreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here%2c from thefading canvas%2c smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux%2c in her gauze hood%2c pearlstomacher%2c and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand%2cand her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.  Ona table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were largegreen rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life%2c andthe strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he somethingof her temperament in him?  These oval%2c heavy-lidded eyes seemed tolook curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby%2c with his powderedhair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face wassaturnine and swarthy%2c and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted withdisdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands thatwere so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the eighteenthcentury%2c and the friend%2c in his youth%2c of Lord Ferrars.  What of thesecond Lord Beckenham%2c the companion of the Prince Regent in hiswildest days%2c and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was%2c with his chestnut curlsand insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?  The world hadlooked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at Carlton House.The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.  Beside him hung theportrait of his wife%2c a pallid%2c thin-lipped woman in black.  Her blood%2calso%2c stirred within him.  How curious it all seemed!  And his motherwith her Lady Hamilton face and her moist%2c wine-dashed lips--he knewwhat he had got from her.  He had got from her his beauty%2c and hispassion for the beauty of others.  She laughed at him in her looseBacchante dress.  There were vine leaves in her hair.  The purplespilled from the cup she was holding.  The carnations of the paintinghad withered%2c but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth andbrilliancy of colour.  They seemed to follow him wherever he went.,The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

He sighed%2c and took up the volume again%2c and tried to forget.  He readof the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafe_ at Smyrna wherethe Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchantssmoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; heread of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears ofgranite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot%2clotus-covered Nile%2c where there are Sphinxes%2c and rose-red ibises%2c andwhite vultures with gilded claws%2c and crocodiles with small beryl eyesthat crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over thoseverses which%2c drawing music from kiss-stained marble%2c tell of thatcurious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice%2c the "_monstrecharmant_" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.  But after atime the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous%2c and a horrible fitof terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should be out ofEngland?

The royal Peleus%2c when from Pthia's coast  He sent thee early to the Achaian host;  Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd%2c  And new to perils of the direful field:  He bade me teach thee all the ways of war%2c  To shine in councils%2c and in camps to dare.  Never%2c ah%2c never let me leave thy side!  No time shall part us%2c and no fate divide%2c  Not though the god%2c that breathed my life%2c restore  The bloom I boasted%2c and the port I bore%2c  When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames  (Delightful Greece%2c the land of lovely dames)%2c  My father faithless to my mother's arms%2c  Old as he was%2c adored a stranger's charms.  I tried what youth could do (at her desire)  To win the damsel%2c and prevent my sire.  My sire with curses loads my hated head%2c  And cries%2c 'Ye furies! barren be his bed.'  Infernal Jove%2c the vengeful fiends below%2c  And ruthless Proserpine%2c confirm'd his vow.  Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!  Gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!  I thought (but some kind god that thought suppress'd)  To plunge the poniard in my father's breast;  Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain  With prayers entreat me%2c and with force detain.  On fat of rams%2c black bulls%2c and brawny swine%2c  They daily feast%2c with draughts of fragrant wine;  Strong guards they placed%2c and watch'd nine nights entire;  The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.  The tenth%2c I forced the gates%2c unseen of all:  And%2c favour'd by the night%2c o'erleap'd the wall%2c  My travels thence through spacious Greece extend;  In Phthia's court at last my labours end.  Your sire received me%2c as his son caress'd%2c  With gifts enrich'd%2c and with possessions bless'd.  The strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign%2c  And all the coast that runs along the main.  By love to thee his bounties I repaid%2c  And early wisdom to thy soul convey'd:  Great as thou art%2c my lessons made thee brave:  A child I took thee%2c but a hero gave.  Thy infant breast a like affection show'd;  Still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)  Or at my knee%2c by Phoenix wouldst thou stand;  No food was grateful but from Phoenix' hand.(211)  I pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years%2c  The tender labours%2c the compliant cares%2c  The gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree%2c  And Phoenix felt a father's joys in thee:  Thy growing virtues justified my cares%2c  And promised comfort to my silver hairs.  Now be thy rage%2c thy fatal rage%2c resign'd;  A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:  The gods (the only great%2c and only wise)  Are moved by offerings%2c vows%2c and sacrifice;  Offending man their high compassion wins%2c  And daily prayers atone for daily sins.  Prayers are Jove's daughters%2c of celestial race%2c  Lame are their feet%2c and wrinkled is their face;  With humble mien%2c and with dejected eyes%2c  Constant they follow%2c where injustice flies.  Injustice swift%2c erect%2c and unconfined%2c  Sweeps the wide earth%2c and tramples o'er mankind%2c  While Prayers%2c to heal her wrongs%2c move slow behind.  Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove%2c  For him they mediate to the throne above  When man rejects the humble suit they make%2c  The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;  From Jove commission'd%2c fierce injustice then  Descends to punish unrelenting men.  O let not headlong passion bear the sway  These reconciling goddesses obey  Due honours to the seed of Jove belong%2c  Due honours calm the fierce%2c and bend the strong.  Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring%2c  Were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king;  Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage  Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.  But since what honour asks the general sends%2c  And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;  The best and noblest of the Grecian train;  Permit not these to sue%2c and sue in vain!  Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold%2c  A great example drawn from times of old;  Hear what our fathers were%2c and what their praise%2c  Who conquer'd their revenge in former days.,The Iliad by Homer

I see you did.  Don't speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say.Dorian%2c from the moment I met you%2c your personality had the mostextraordinary influence over me.  I was dominated%2c soul%2c brain%2c andpower%2c by you.  You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseenideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  Iworshipped you.  I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  Iwanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy when I was withyou.  When you were away from me%2c you were still present in my art....Of course%2c I never let you know anything about this.  It would havebeen impossible.  You would not have understood it.  I hardlyunderstood it myself.  I only knew that I had seen perfection face toface%2c and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--toowonderful%2c perhaps%2c for in such mad worships there is peril%2c the perilof losing them%2c no less than the peril of keeping them....  Weeks andweeks went on%2c and I grew more and more absorbed in you.  Then came anew development.  I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour%2c and asAdonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned withheavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge%2c gazingacross the green turbid Nile.  You had leaned over the still pool ofsome Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel ofyour own face.  And it had all been what art should be--unconscious%2cideal%2c and remote.  One day%2c a fatal day I sometimes think%2c Idetermined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are%2cnot in the costume of dead ages%2c but in your own dress and in your owntime.  Whether it was the realism of the method%2c or the mere wonder ofyour own personality%2c thus directly presented to me without mist orveil%2c I cannot tell.  But I know that as I worked at it%2c every flakeand film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraidthat others would know of my idolatry.  I felt%2c Dorian%2c that I had toldtoo much%2c that I had put too much of myself into it.  Then it was thatI resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  You were alittle annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.Harry%2c to whom I talked about it%2c laughed at me.  But I did not mindthat.  When the picture was finished%2c and I sat alone with it%2c I feltthat I was right.... Well%2c after a few days the thing left my studio%2cand as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of itspresence%2c it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that Ihad seen anything in it%2c more than that you were extremely good-lookingand that I could paint.  Even now I cannot help feeling that it is amistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever reallyshown in the work one creates.  Art is always more abstract than wefancy.  Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  Itoften seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely thanit ever reveals him.  And so when I got this offer from Paris%2c Idetermined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.It never occurred to me that you would refuse.  I see now that you wereright.  The picture cannot be shown.  You must not be angry with me%2cDorian%2c for what I have told you.

What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I amprepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets%2cwho are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst%2cwhatever they shall please to say%2c they may give me some concern as theyare unhappy men%2c but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided inthis translation by judgments very different from theirs%2c and by personsfor whom they can have no kindness%2c if an old observation be true%2c thatthe strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr.Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task;who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as Icannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for avery early recommendation of my undertaking to the public. Dr. Swiftpromoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves hisfriend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I neverknew wanting on any occasion. I must also acknowledge%2c with infinitepleasure%2c the many friendly offices%2c as well as sincere criticisms%2c of Mr.Congreve%2c who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. Imust add the names of Mr. Rowe%2c and Dr. Parnell%2c though I shall take afurther opportunity of doing justice to the last%2c whose good nature (togive it a great panegyric)%2c is no less extensive than his learning. Thefavour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears themso true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of thegreat have done me; while the first names of the age appear as mysubscribers%2c and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learningas my chief encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me tofind%2c that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour tothe name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeasedI should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellentEssay)%2c so complete a praise:,The Iliad by Homer
