The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;  Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:  Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,  The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;  And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,  To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,  Host against host with shadowy legends drew,  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;  Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,  Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.  Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,  O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,  Commutual death the fate of war confounds,  Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.

Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;  The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;  Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;  Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.  Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;  The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.  Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,  Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:  Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd  Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.  Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart  Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;  Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing man  Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;  Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,  Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.  Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed  The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,  When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,  Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.

Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,  If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,  There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,  And with Orestes' self divide his care.  Yet more--three daughters in his court are bred,  And each well worthy of a royal bed:  Laodice and Iphigenia fair,  And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:  Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;  He asks no presents, no reward for love:  Himself will give the dower; so vast a store  As never father gave a child before.

But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,  If honour and if interest plead in vain,  Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,  And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.

"  ""Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,  Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;  Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,  But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.  Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,  The wretch and hero find their prize the same.  Alike regretted in the dust he lies,  Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.  Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,  A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?  As the bold bird her helpless young attends,  From danger guards them, and from want defends;  In search of prey she wings the spacious air,  And with the untasted food supplies her care:  For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,  Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;  Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,  And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.  I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,(207)  And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:  Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid  The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.  Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;  Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.  Some present, too, to every prince was paid;  And every prince enjoys the gift he made:  I only must refund, of all his train;  See what pre-eminence our merits gain!  My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:  My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:  The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;  But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?  What to these shores the assembled nations draws,  What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?  Are fair endowments and a beauteous face  Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race?  The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,  Sure every wise and worthy man will love.  Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;  Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.  Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;  Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.  Ye have my answer--what remains to do,  Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.  What needs he the defence this arm can make?  Has he not walls no human force can shake?  Has he not fenced his guarded navy round  With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?  And will not these (the wonders he has done)  Repel the rage of Priam's single son?  There was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)  When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;  He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait  Achilles' fury at the Scaean gate;  He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.  But now those ancient enmities are o'er;  To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;  Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,  And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.  The third day hence shall Pthia greet our sails,(208)  If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;  Pthia to her Achilles shall restore  The wealth he left for this detested shore:  Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,  The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:  My beauteous captives thither I'll convey,  And all that rests of my unravish'd prey.  One only valued gift your tyrant gave,  And that resumed--the fair Lyrnessian slave.  Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,  And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;  (For arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,  And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;  Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes  Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)  Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,  Nor share his council, nor his battle join;  For once deceiv'd, was his; but twice were mine,  No--let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives  Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;  His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind  Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,  Not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,  And all his rapine could from others wrest:  Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown  The many-peopled Orchomenian town;(209)  Not all proud Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,  The world's great empress on the Egyptian plain  (That spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states,  And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,  Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars  From each wide portal issuing to the wars);(210)  Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more  Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;  Should all these offers for my friendship call,  'Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.  Atrides' daughter never shall be led  (An ill-match'd consort) to Achilles' bed;  Like golden Venus though she charm'd the heart,  And vied with Pallas in the works of art;  Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,  I hate alliance with a tyrant's race.  If heaven restore me to my realms with life,  The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;  Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,  And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.  Bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away,  Content with just hereditary sway;  There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,  Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.  Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.  Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold,  Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,  Can bribe the poor possession of a day!  Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,  And steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain:  But from our lips the vital spirit fled,  Returns no more to wake the silent dead.  My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,  And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;  Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,  Short is my date, but deathless my renown:  If I return, I quit immortal praise  For years on years, and long-extended days.  Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,  And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;  To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,  Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.  Jove's arm display'd asserts her from the skies!  Her hearts are strengthen'd, and her glories rise.  Go then to Greece, report our fix'd design;  Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,  Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,  To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.  One stratagem has fail'd, and others will:  Ye find, Achilles is unconquer'd still.  Go then--digest my message as ye may--  But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:  His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand  A peaceful death in Pthia's friendly land.  But whether he remain or sail with me,  His age be sacred, and his will be free.""",The Iliad by Homer

Just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,  Where linen folds the double corslet lined,  She turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,  Pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;  The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,  And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.  As when some stately trappings are decreed  To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,  A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,  Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;  With equal lustre various colours vie,  The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:  So great Atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,  As down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.  With horror seized, the king of men descried  The shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide:  Nor less the Spartan fear'd, before he found  The shining barb appear above the wound,  Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,  The royal brother thus his grief express'd,  And grasp'd his hand; while all the Greeks around  With answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.",The Iliad by Homer

But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,(116)  His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground;  As one unskill'd or dumb, he seem'd to stand,  Nor raised his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand;  But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!

"Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from thebeginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon theexisting habits of society with regard to poetry--for they admit generallythat the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but uponthe supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure thepreservation of the poems--the unassisted memory of reciters being neithersufficient nor trustworthy. But here we only escape a smaller difficultyby running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted withextraordinary memory, (25) is far less astonishing than that of longmanuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and wheneven suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious.Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bardwas under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting amanuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been adisqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, aswell from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of theblind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, aswell as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homerhimself.

As he investigated the subject--and he always hadan extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the momentin whatever he took up--he was almost saddened by the reflection of theruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things.  He, at anyrate, had escaped that.  Summer followed summer, and the yellowjonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated thestory of their shame, but he was unchanged.  No winter marred his faceor stained his flowerlike bloom.  How different it was with materialthings!  Where had they passed to?  Where was the great crocus-colouredrobe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been workedby brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?  Where the huge velariumthat Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sailof purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving achariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?  He longed to see thecurious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which weredisplayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred goldenbees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop ofPontus and were figured with ""lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature""; andthe coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of whichwere embroidered the verses of a song beginning ""_Madame, je suis toutjoyeux_,"" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in goldthread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with fourpearls.

"  Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard  His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd:  The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,  And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.  His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,  A fawn his talons truss'd, (divine portent!)  High o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,  Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;  Then let the prey before his altar fall;  The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:  Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,  And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.  Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,  O'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,  Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,  And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.  Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)  With flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire;  Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd;  The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:  Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;  His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.  Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;  The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:  Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd,  And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;  Evaemon's son next issues to the foe,  And last young Teucer with his bended bow.  Secure behind the Telamonian shield  The skilful archer wide survey'd the field,  With every shaft some hostile victim slew,  Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:  The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,  Retires for safety to the mother's arms.  Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,  Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.  Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled?  Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:  The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain,  With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:  Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;  The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.  Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,  A Trojan ghost attending every dart.  Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye  The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:  ""O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)  Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;  Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,  Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!  Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,  The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:  Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,  And the brave son repays his cares with fame.  Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers  Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;  Whatever treasures Greece for me design,  The next rich honorary gift be thine:  Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,  With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:  Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,  Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love.""",The Iliad by Homer

This distinction is the more to beacknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified theprejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of particular men.Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking inwhich I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons ofmerit; and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that aregenerally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither whollyunuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.",The Iliad by Homer

They are detained by the management ofUlysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly isrecalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the adviceof Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, andto divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded tobattle. This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of theGreeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.",The Iliad by Homer
“Well%2c” said Charlotte%2c “I wish Jane success with all my heart; andif she were married to him to-morrow%2c I should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. Ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand%2c it does not advance their felicity in theleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.”,Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

"Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its doublechime, but Dorian Gray did not stir.  He was trying to gather up thescarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find hisway through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he waswandering.  He did not know what to do, or what to think.  Finally, hewent over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he hadloved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.  Hecovered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words ofpain.  There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, wefeel that no one else has a right to blame us.  It is the confession,not the priest, that gives us absolution.  When Dorian had finished theletter, he felt that he had been forgiven.",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousandmarks, which was covered with balas rubies.  Hall described Henry VIII,on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing ""ajacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and otherrich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses.""The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in goldfiligrane.  Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armourstudded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set withturquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parseme_ with pearls.

"They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it. Itis, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, isnot discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullestsplendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, andbecomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exactdisposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may havebeen found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this ""vivida vis animi,""in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected,this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove.Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightensall the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. Thisfire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflectedfrom Homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant:in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden, short, and interruptedflashes: In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardourby the force of art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like anaccidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burnseverywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly.",The Iliad by Homer

"An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw in thedim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him.  There wassomething in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at!The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled thatmarvellous beauty.  There was still some gold in the thinning hair andsome scarlet on the sensual mouth.  The sodden eyes had kept somethingof the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yetcompletely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat.Yes, it was Dorian himself.  But who had done it?  He seemed torecognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design.  Theidea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid.  He seized the lighted candle,and held it to the picture.

"  He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,  His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;  (The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)(135)  To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:  ""O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame  The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)  Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,  With hands unactive, and a careless eye?  Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;  Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:  What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,  Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?  I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,  A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae's towers;  Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,  Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;  While dreadful comets glaring from afar,  Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.(136)  Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,  A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;  Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,  Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.  The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,  And dared to combat all those chiefs around:  Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;  For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.  Stung with the shame, within the winding way,  To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;  Two heroes led the secret squadron on,  Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;  Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.  He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,  Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;  Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!""",The Iliad by Homer
