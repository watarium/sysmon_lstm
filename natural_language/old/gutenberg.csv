Indeed, there were many,especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had oftendreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something ofthe real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction andperfect manner of a citizen of the world.

Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows  With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.  His massy spear with matchless fury sent,  Through Amphius' belt and heaving belly went;  Amphius Apaesus' happy soil possess'd,  With herds abounding, and with treasure bless'd;  But fate resistless from his country led  The chief, to perish at his people's head.  Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,  And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;  Around his head an iron tempest rain'd;  A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd:  Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd,  And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:  He could no more; the showering darts denied  To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.

Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready tobelieve anything to the detriment of those who are both rich andfascinating.  It feels instinctively that manners are of moreimportance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectabilityis of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.  And, afterall, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who hasgiven one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his privatelife.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, asLord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there ispossibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the canons of goodsociety are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.  Form isabsolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity of a ceremony,as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character ofa romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightfulto us.

As he looked back upon man moving throughhistory, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So much had beensurrendered! and to such little purpose!

The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,  Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.  First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,  With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.  As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,  With beating bosom, and with eager pace,  Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,  Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;  Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;  Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.  When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;  Before the ships a desperate stand they made,  And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.  Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:  His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame  That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:  Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!

That of Achilles isfurious and intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice,and subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; ofHector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited bylove of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness andtenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; inSarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishingdiversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes themain of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which hetakes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the maincharacters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinctin this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the othernatural, open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage;and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the differenceof his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the otherupon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds.The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner;they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where theyare marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer.His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no waypeculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing thatdifferences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, orthe rest, In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that anair of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savagecourage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &c. They have aparity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. Ibelieve when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he willpursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced howinfinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that ofall others.",The Iliad by Homer

"At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, keptHomer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of theverses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient poetryto be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers,neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him. At hisdeparture, Homer is said to have observed: ""O Thestorides, of the manythings hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligiblethan the human heart.""(8)",The Iliad by Homer

To her the chief retired from stern debate,  But found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:  Althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,  Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;  She beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath  On her own son to wreak her brother's death;  Hell heard her curses from the realms profound,  And the red fiends that walk the nightly round.  In vain Ćtolia her deliverer waits,  War shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.

Meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;  The walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;  At length his wife (a form divine) appears,  With piercing cries, and supplicating tears;  She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,  The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,  The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:  The warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.  The Ćtolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,  And left the chief their broken faith to mourn.  Learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,  Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;  Accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;  And be amongst our guardian gods adored.""",The Iliad by Homer

"No, said Dorian Gray, ""there is nothing fearful about it.  It is oneof the great romantic tragedies of the age.  As a rule, people who actlead the most commonplace lives.  They are good husbands, or faithfulwives, or something tedious.  You know what I mean--middle-class virtueand all that kind of thing.  How different Sibyl was!  She lived herfinest tragedy.  She was always a heroine.  The last night sheplayed--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had knownthe reality of love.  When she knew its unreality, she died, as Julietmight have died.  She passed again into the sphere of art.  There issomething of the martyr about her.  Her death has all the patheticuselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.  But, as I was saying,you must not think I have not suffered.  If you had come in yesterdayat a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter tosix--you would have found me in tears.  Even Harry, who was here, whobrought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through.  Isuffered immensely.  Then it passed away.  I cannot repeat an emotion.No one can, except sentimentalists.  And you are awfully unjust, Basil.You come down here to console me.  That is charming of you.  You findme consoled, and you are furious.  How like a sympathetic person!  Youremind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist whospent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievanceredressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was.Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.  Hehad absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became aconfirmed misanthrope.  And besides, my dear old Basil, if you reallywant to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or tosee it from a proper artistic point of view.  Was it not Gautier whoused to write about _la consolation des arts_?  I remember picking up alittle vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on thatdelightful phrase.  Well, I am not like that young man you told me ofwhen we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to saythat yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.  Ilove beautiful things that one can touch and handle.  Old brocades,green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings,luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these.  But the artistictemperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more tome.  To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is toescape the suffering of life.  I know you are surprised at my talkingto you like this.  You have not realized how I have developed.  I was aschoolboy when you knew me.  I am a man now.  I have new passions, newthoughts, new ideas.  I am different, but you must not like me less.  Iam changed, but you must always be my friend.  Of course, I am veryfond of Harry.  But I know that you are better than he is.  You are notstronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better.  And howhappy we used to be together!  Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrelwith me.  I am what I am.  There is nothing more to be said.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly  Between the extended earth and starry sky.  But when to Ida's topmost height he came,  (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)  Where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,  His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:  There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire  Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:  Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;  High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;  Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,  The town, and tents, and navigable seas.",The Iliad by Homer

"  ""Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race  With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.  Not such at Argos was their generous vow:  Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:  Ne'er to return, was then the common cry,  Till Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.  Behold them weeping for their native shore;  What could their wives or helpless children more?  What heart but melts to leave the tender train,  And, one short month, endure the wintry main?  Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,  When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:  Then well may this long stay provoke their tears,  The tedious length of nine revolving years.  Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;  But vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!  Expect the time to Troy's destruction given.  And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.  What pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,(89)  And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.  Beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised  Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:  'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,  The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground  A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;  From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.  Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,  And curl'd around in many a winding fold;  The topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;  Eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;  Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,  Stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;  While hovering near, with miserable moan,  The drooping mother wail'd her children gone.  The mother last, as round the nest she flew,  Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;  Nor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands  A lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.  Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare  Trust in his omen, and support the war.  For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,  And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,  Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,(90)  'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.  This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,  Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.  As many birds as by the snake were slain,  So many years the toils of Greece remain;  But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'  Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.  Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,  Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.""  He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,  The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.  Then Nestor thus--""These vain debates forbear,  Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.  Where now are all your high resolves at last?  Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?  Vow'd with libations and with victims then,  Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!  While useless words consume the unactive hours,  No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.  Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;  We march to war, if thou direct the way.  But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,  The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,  To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,  And view with envy our successful wars.  On that great day, when first the martial train,  Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,  Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,  And thunder rolling shook the firmament.  Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,  Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,  Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear,  And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.  Before that day, if any Greek invite  His country's troops to base, inglorious flight,  Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,  And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.  But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:(91)  Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.  Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;  In tribes and nations to divide thy train:  His separate troops let every leader call,  Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.  What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,  Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,  When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known  And what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;  If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,  If gods above prevent, or men below.""",The Iliad by Homer
"  ""Long since had Hector stain'd these fields with gore,  Stretch'd by some Argive on his native shore:  But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,  Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;  The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,  Forgets my service and deserved reward:  Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress'd,  By stern Eurystheus with long labours press'd?  He begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay;  I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.  Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,  When to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;  The triple dog had never felt his chain,  Nor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.  Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,  At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;  To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,  My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.  Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved  To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.  Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;  Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.  Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?  (That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)  When Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,  All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!  What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,  Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,  Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?""",The Iliad by Homer

"He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeedhe had for everything connected with the service of the Church.  In thelong cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he hadstored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really theraiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels andfine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn bythe suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain.He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set insix-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was thepine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were dividedinto panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and thecoronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.This was Italian work of the fifteenth century.  Another cope was ofgreen velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of whichwere picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals.  The morsebore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work.  The orphreys werewoven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred withmedallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and goldbrocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured withrepresentations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, andembroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics ofwhite satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphinsand _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; andmany corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.

"To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected thecompound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper topoetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted andfilled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced insome measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannotbut attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (ashe has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of thepersons or things to which they were joined. We see the motion of Hector'splumes in the epithet Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in thatof Einosiphyllos, and so of others, which particular images could not havebeen insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though butof a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principalaction or figure.

"It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent inour language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain noliteral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superiorlanguage: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that arash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no lessin danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modernmanners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often alight in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almostliteral. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which arenecessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting thepoetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there havenot been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence tothe letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hopeof raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted, that thefire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it ismost likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to becontent with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, withoutendeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particularplace. It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and whenpoetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we willbut follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty,let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, weought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring thecensure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems tohave been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some ofhis translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of thesublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion ofsimplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, somesweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certainsigns of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train,while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected andequal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could soonerpardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for suchcommendations, as he may gain by that character of style, which hisfriends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the worldwill call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as wellas a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the airof a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up,and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean betweenostentation and rusticity.",The Iliad by Homer

"He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no realappreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of thebeauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.  Hisdominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he hadspent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had takena good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.  Indeed, he wasstill devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of hisown in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to theannoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing forParliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made upprescriptions.  He was an excellent musician, however, as well, andplayed both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.  Infact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Graytogether--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed tobe able to exercise whenever he wished--and, indeed, exercised oftenwithout being conscious of it.  They had met at Lady Berkshire's thenight that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be alwaysseen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.  Foreighteen months their intimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either atSelby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, DorianGray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating inlife.  Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no oneever knew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke whenthey met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from anyparty at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too--wasstrangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearingmusic, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he wascalled upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no timeleft in which to practise.  And this was certainly true.

"This play was good enough for us, Harry.  It was Romeo and Juliet.  Imust admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespearedone in such a wretched hole of a place.  Still, I felt interested, ina sort of way.  At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who satat a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last thedrop-scene was drawn up and the play began.  Romeo was a stout elderlygentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figurelike a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad.  He was played by thelow-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on mostfriendly terms with the pit.  They were both as grotesque as thescenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. ButJuliet!  Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with alittle, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils ofdark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that werelike the petals of a rose.  She was the loveliest thing I had ever seenin my life.  You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but thatbeauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears.  I tell you,Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that cameacross me.  And her voice--I never heard such a voice.  It was very lowat first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one'sear.  Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or adistant hautboy.  In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasythat one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.  Therewere moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins.  Youknow how a voice can stir one.  Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vaneare two things that I shall never forget.  When I close my eyes, I hearthem, and each of them says something different.

"As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of wholenarrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse orhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, asneither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor tooffend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungracefulin those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort ofinsolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or fromhigher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonialof religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, orthe like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is, to be guided by thenearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in theoriginal: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but itis a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any:if they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.",The Iliad by Homer

The force of this faculty is seenin nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that singlecircumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out intoembellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as notto overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where theprincipal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to theoriginal, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. Thesame will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisonstogether in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so manyvarious and correspondent images.

Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems torevel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to Senecaare by _four_ different authors.(34) Now, I will venture to assert, thatthese tragedies are so uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology--aphraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus weremore charmed than ourselves--in their freedom from real poetry, and last,but not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of goodtaste, that few writers of the present day would question the capabilitiesof the same gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, buta great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouinastonished the world with the startling announcement that the Ćneid ofVirgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, withoutwishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry andlearning--nay, the refined acuteness--which scholars, like Wolf, havebestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of ourmodern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise andentertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity.

Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,  And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,  The king of kings his awful figure raised:  High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;  The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,  By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.  To Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;  The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,  In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,  To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;  And now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,  Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.(83)",The Iliad by Homer

Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light  Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:  Some space at least permit the war to breathe,  While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,  From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,  And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;  So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,  And pious children o'er their ashes weep.  Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,  High o'er them all a general tomb be raised;  Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,  Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;  From space to space be ample gates around,  For passing chariots; and a trench profound.

"What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardlydeserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in thecourse of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavourto exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raisethe superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, bythe whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much asheard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoevercompares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse himfor the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as whenthey prefer the fable and moral of the Ćneis to those of the Iliad, forthe same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the Ćneis; as that thehero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to hiscountry than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing whathe never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a princeas Ćneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Othersselect those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured assome that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management ofScaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low andmean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement,oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumphin the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct ofPerrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to afairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, andthat of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the greatreputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times,and the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of thisprinciple, they make those accidents (such as the contention of thecities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality theconsequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, orany great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casualadditions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; whoyet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he musthave been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in hissense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.(39)",The Iliad by Homer

"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according totheir usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, myfriend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper atthe doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, northief nor wild beast will approach the fold.
Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Havingfinished supper, they banqueted(10) afresh on conversation, Homernarrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.
At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucusresolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting withHomer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homerat home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a placenear the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole storyrespecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what hesaid, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimedand enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger to him.
Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuringhim that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed thatthe stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and theChian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of hischildren.(11)
Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from theisland, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher.

"Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us ishis invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of hiswork; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive andcopious than any other, his manners more lively and strongly marked, hisspeeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm andsublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, hisexpression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various.I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of theseheads, I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurdor endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by anopposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment fromthence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledgeof the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is inthat we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that weare to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in morethan one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has injudgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, becauseVirgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention,because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authorshad more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to haveless in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgilthe better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgilleads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generousprofusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like theNile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a riverin its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold theirbattles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. Homer,boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all before him, and shinesmore and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like Ćneas,appears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him,and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines,Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus,scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens: Virgil, like the samepower in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans forempires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.",The Iliad by Homer

When your commands have hearten'd every band,  Ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;  Press'd as we are, and sore of former fight,  These straits demand our last remains of might.  Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,  And teach our mother what the gods require:  Direct the queen to lead the assembled train  Of Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;(166)  Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,  With offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.  The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,  Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,  Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,  And twelve young heifers to her altars led:  If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,  Our wives, our infants, and our city spare,  And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,  That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;  Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,  Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;  Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,  In rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.""",The Iliad by Homer

The very sharpness of the contrast used toquicken his sense of pleasure.  He grew more and more enamoured of hisown beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous andterrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling foreheador crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes whichwere the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.

Certainly few people had ever interested him so much asDorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else causedhim not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.  He was pleased byit.  It made him a more interesting study.  He had been alwaysenthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinarysubject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of noimport.  And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended byvivisecting others.  Human life--that appeared to him the one thingworth investigating.  Compared to it there was nothing else of anyvalue.  It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible ofpain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making theimagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.  Therewere poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sickenof them.  There were maladies so strange that one had to pass throughthem if one sought to understand their nature.  And, yet, what a greatreward one received!  How wonderful the whole world became to one!  Tonote the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured lifeof the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were atdiscord--there was a delight in that!

"At what period, continues Grote, ""these poems, or indeed any other Greekpoems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, thoughthere is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon. If, inthe absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinateperiod, the question a once suggests itself, What were the purposes which,in that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must havebeen intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not forthe rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, butalso interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with allthose flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artificeswhich were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscriptcould never reproduce. Not for the general public--they were accustomed toreceive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of asolemn and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliadwould be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a classof readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they hadexperienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing thewritten words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of theimpression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement mayseem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, andthere was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. Ifwe could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, weshould be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems werefirst committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatestprobability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even ofthe narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventhcentury before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age ofTerpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, &c. I ground thissupposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies ofGrecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having beenintroduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositionshaving been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present andreal life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the onlyknown mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable,yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of lookingat the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for newpoetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well beconsidered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from theirown individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies,just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebaisas the production of Homer. There seems, therefore, ground forconjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, butvery narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other oldepics,--the Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and theOdyssey,--began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century(B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took placeabout the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtainingthe requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed,would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along withit; so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readersand manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained acertain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference againstthe carelessness of individual rhapsodes.""(26)",The Iliad by Homer

By me that holy office were profaned;  Ill fits it me, with human gore distain'd,  To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,  Or offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.  You, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,  And burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.

So may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,  Our wives, our infants, and our city spare;  And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,  Who mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.  Be this, O mother, your religious care:  I go to rouse soft Paris to the war;  If yet not lost to all the sense of shame,  The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.

Among these visitors, oneMentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge andintelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to closehis school, and accompany him on his travels. He promised not only to payhis expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that,""While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his owneyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of hisdiscourses."" Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron,""examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, andinforming himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met."" Wemay also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy ofpreservation(2) Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reachedIthaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, becamemuch worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him tothe medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son ofAlcinor.

"Moreover, he continues, ""the whole tenor of the poems themselvesconfirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad orOdyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age ofPeisistratus--nothing which brings to our view the alterations broughtabout by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, thehabits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments,the close military array, the improved construction of ships, theAmphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of religiousfestivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c., familiar tothe latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the other literaryfriends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to notice, even withoutdesign, had they then, for the first time, undertaken the task of piecingtogether many self existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything inthe two great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs toan age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even theinterpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, arepronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ,and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus--in some caseseven by Arktinus and Hesiod--as genuine Homeric matter(29) As far as theevidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge,we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recitedsubstantially as they now stand (always allowing for paitial divergencesof text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark ofGrecian time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is thebest-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of theHomeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they thusafford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the Greeks,enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation, and toseize instructive contrasts between their former and their latercondition.""(30)",The Iliad by Homer

"  Then fierce Ćneas, brandishing his blade,  In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,  Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,  In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:(152)  Sprung from Alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields  Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.  He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,  And these descended in the third degree.  Too early expert in the martial toil,  In sable ships they left their native soil,  To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,  They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.  So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood  In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,  Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd  Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:  Till pierced at distance from their native den,  O'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.  Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,  Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.  Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,  Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;  Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,  The god but urged him to provoke his fate.  He thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son  Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;  Struck with the thought, should Helen's lord be slain,  And all his country's glorious labours vain.  Already met, the threatening heroes stand;  The spears already tremble in their hand:  In rush'd Antilochus, his aid to bring,  And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.  These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his course,  Brave as he was, and shunn'd unequal force.  The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,  Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.",The Iliad by Homer

Now martial law commands us to forbear;  Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,  Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,  And let the gods decide of death or life!  Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,  And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.  Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,  And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;  As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,  Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.

Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,  Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,  To see no wholesome motion be withstood,  And ratify the best for public good.  Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,  But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.  Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,  At once my present judgment and my past.  When from Pelides' tent you forced the maid,  I first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;  But bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,  You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:  Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,  With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend.""",The Iliad by Homer

Thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,  Nor break the sacred union of the sky:  Lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless'd abodes,  Launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.

"Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justiceto Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertainwithout much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than anyentire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman,Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurablelength of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrasemore loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of fouror six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey,ver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistakenin so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if hedid not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles.He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings outof his author; insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem ofthe mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured tostrain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved infustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, asin the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the manmay account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his prefaceand remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast inpoetry. His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less thanfifteen weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. Butthat which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to coverhis defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, whichis something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writbefore he arrived at years of discretion.",The Iliad by Homer

"  He said, and rising, high above the field  Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.  Full on the brass descending from above  Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,  Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;  Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,  His corslet enters, and his garment rends,  And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.  The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low  Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.  From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,  Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;  Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,  Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.  At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;  The blunted point against the buckler bends;  But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,  Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;  It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!  Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.  Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,  In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,  Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;  Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;  The hollow brass resounded with the shock:  Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,  Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,  With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;  The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:  His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;  Great Hector falls extended on the field,  His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:  Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might  Confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.  And now both heroes their broad falchions drew  In flaming circles round their heads they flew;  But then by heralds' voice the word was given.

And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,  Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;  And first Idaeus' awful voice was heard:",The Iliad by Homer

As itwas, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name men gave totheir mistakes.  Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode ofwarning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formationof character, had praised it as something that taught us what to followand showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive power inexperience.  It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the sameas our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, wewould do many times, and with joy.",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in whichcritics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everythingelse, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubtand uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions ofPlato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the _dramatispersonae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears asthe enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of thewriters who have handed them down.

Were faith novirtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on anymatter. But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems asthough our faith should be especially tried touching the men and theevents which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity.And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great andthe good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which wouldallegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure thegiants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.",The Iliad by Homer

Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;  And two brave leaders at an instant slew;  Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,  His people's pastor, good Hypenor, died;  Astynous' breast the deadly lance receives,  Hypenor's shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.  Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage  Abas and Polyidus to engage;  Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,  Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;  The youths return'd not from the doubtful plain,  And the sad father tried his arts in vain;  No mystic dream could make their fates appear,  Though now determined by Tydides' spear.",The Iliad by Homer

"And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in whichprogress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in whichpersons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu oftheir conventional value. The same principles which have swept awaytraditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues ofsinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractivesuperstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. Thecredulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful atouchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of atemperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or theimpostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition,whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to verydifferent handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of formerages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motivesof the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of hishistory, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful andtroublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a largeportion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no lesspertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, wemust know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction ofextended experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which humanexperience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form correctviews of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a greatwhole--we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whomthey are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives orcondition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather considerthe general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respectiveprobability of its details.",The Iliad by Homer

""Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)  Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.  See! bold Idomeneus superior towers  Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,  Great as a god! I saw him once before,  With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.  The rest I know, and could in order name;  All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.  Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,  Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:  Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,  One bold on foot, and one renown'd for horse.  My brothers these; the same our native shore,  One house contain'd us, as one mother bore.

The weapon flies  At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:  He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,  And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.  (Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,  This offspring added to king Priam's line.)  As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,(196)  Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;  So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd  Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.  Another shaft the raging archer drew,  That other shaft with erring fury flew,  (From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)  Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:  Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,  And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.  Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms  The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.  Hector with grief his charioteer beheld  All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:  Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,  Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.  Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,  And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.  The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;  The shaft already to his shoulder drew;  The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,  Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;  There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,  The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:  The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,  And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.  He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,  And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;  Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore  The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.",The Iliad by Homer

"Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what ashare of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfiedwith his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, butsearched through its different dialects with this particular view, tobeautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greatermixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as theverse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he mostaffected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its neverusing contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs intotwo syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a morespreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the Atticcontractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler Ćolic, which oftenrejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this varietyby altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus his measures,instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to runalong with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a furtherrepresentation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds towhat they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony whichmakes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear inthe world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult thetune of his verses, even without understanding them (with the same sort ofdiligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), willfind more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any otherlanguage of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics tobe copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as toascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has someadvantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn andcadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in workingup a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of,and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his line to abeautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been sofrequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is,that fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysiusof Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in thiskind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices at presentto observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to makeone imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as theMuses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiritingvigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. Theyroll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; whilewe are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the mostsmooth imaginable.",The Iliad by Homer

Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,  The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;  Then let a midway space our hosts divide,  And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:  By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,  For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;  And who his rival can in arms subdue,  His be the fair, and his the treasure too.  Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,  And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;  Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,  Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.""",The Iliad by Homer

How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn  Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!  What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,  O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!  Once with what joy the generous prince would hear  Of every chief who fought this glorious war,  Participate their fame, and pleased inquire  Each name, each action, and each hero's sire!  Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,  And trembling all before one hostile hand;  How would he lift his aged arms on high,  Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!  Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,  Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!  Years might again roll back, my youth renew,  And give this arm the spring which once it knew  When fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,  I led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,  And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,  Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.(179)  There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,  Proud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;  Great Areithous, known from shore to shore  By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;  No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,  But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.  Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,  Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,  Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,  Nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.  Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before  Had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:  But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,  To Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.  Furious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,  And dared the trial of the strongest hands;  Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:  All saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway  Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,  And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.  I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:  Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.  What then I was, O were your Nestor now!  Not Hector's self should want an equal foe.  But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,  The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,  Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,  Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?""",The Iliad by Homer

Be said, and poised in air the javelin sent,  Through Paris' shield the forceful weapon went,  His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,  And glancing downward, near his flank descends.

"  Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy  Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.  The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,  Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.  With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,  And Hector hasted to relieve his child,  The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,  And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;  Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,  Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:",The Iliad by Homer

"It is said that passion makes one think in a circle.  Certainly withhideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshapedthose subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found inthem the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, byintellectual approval, passions that without such justification wouldstill have dominated his temper.  From cell to cell of his brain creptthe one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of allman's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,became dear to him now for that very reason.  Ugliness was the onereality.  The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence ofdisordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were morevivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the graciousshapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.  They were what he neededfor forgetfulness.  In three days he would be free.",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,  And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.  The long reflections of the distant fires  Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.  A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,  And shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.

Now shameful flight alone can save the host,  Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.  So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!  At whose command whole empires rise or fall:  He shakes the feeble props of human trust,  And towns and armies humbles to the dust  What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,  Oh, lasting shame in every future age!  Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,  Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.  So small their number, that if wars were ceased,  And Greece triumphant held a general feast,  All rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine  Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.(84)  But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,  And Troy prevails by armies not her own.  Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,  Since first the labours of this war begun:  Our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,  And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.  Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!  Our weeping wives, our tender children call:  Love, duty, safety, summon us away,  'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey,  Our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,  Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.

"To proceed to the allegorical fable--If we reflect upon those innumerableknowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer isgenerally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new andample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us! How fertile willthat imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the properties ofelements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in formsand persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature ofthe things they shadowed! This is a field in which no succeeding poetscould dispute with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowedthem on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlargedhis circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when themode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was deliveredin a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poetsto lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it wasno unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time thatdemand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishingall those allegorical parts of a poem.",The Iliad by Homer

"In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to thehonour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed thecharacteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, hestill continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewerfaults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but thatwarmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses whichholds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment. Homer notonly appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of otherarts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeededhim. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room forcontraction or regulation. He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; andif he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attemptedeverything. A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises fromthe most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, andproduces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasureand profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults,have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richnessof nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.",The Iliad by Homer

Full at the chief, above his courser's head,  From Mars's arm the enormous weapon fled:  Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance  Far from the car the strong immortal lance.  Then threw the force of Tydeus' warlike son;  The javelin hiss'd; the goddess urged it on:  Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,  It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.  From the rent skin the warrior tugs again  The smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:  Loud as the roar encountering armies yield,  When shouting millions shake the thundering field.  Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;  And earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.  As vapours blown by Auster's sultry breath,  Pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,  Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,  Choke the parch'd earth, and blacken all the skies;  In such a cloud the god from combat driven,  High o'er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.  Wild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,  There sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,  Show'd the celestial blood, and with a groan  Thus pour'd his plaints before the immortal throne:",The Iliad by Homer

While it is to be confessed, that Wolf'sobjections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have neverbeen wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed toenlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties withwhich the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, ifwe admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's(28) modification of his theoryany better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad intosixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that theiramalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than theage of Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, ""explains the gaps andcontradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else."" Moreover,we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-calledsixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in thefirst battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of theEuboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, ofthe Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroesagain make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that""it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have soharmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel."" Thediscrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the fifthbook, weeps at his son's funeral in the thirteenth, can only be regardedas the result of an interpolation.",The Iliad by Homer

"Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and themarvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, thoughthey did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of suchas, though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and mannerof telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, ""Thereturn of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy,"" or the like.That of the Iliad is the ""anger of Achilles,"" the most short and singlesubject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with avaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater numberof councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to befound even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude andirregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, andits whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want ofso warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, aswell as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of bothHomer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his.The other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried itso far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity ofaction, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor isit only in the main design that they have been unable to add to hisinvention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of story.If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up theirforces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgilhas the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroysthe unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit theshades, the Ćneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If hebe detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so is Ćneas byDido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on thescore of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself justas long on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestialarmour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has notonly observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led theway, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon,and the taking of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for wordfrom Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Ćneas are taken from those ofMedea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.",The Iliad by Homer

"It is an interesting question, said Lord Henry, who found anexquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, ""anextremely interesting question.  I fancy that the true explanation isthis:  It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in suchan inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, theirabsolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lackof style.  They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.  They give usan impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements ofbeauty crosses our lives.  If these elements of beauty are real, thewhole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  Suddenlywe find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of theplay.  Or rather we are both.  We watch ourselves, and the mere wonderof the spectacle enthralls us.  In the present case, what is it thathas really happened?  Some one has killed herself for love of you.  Iwish that I had ever had such an experience.  It would have made me inlove with love for the rest of my life.  The people who have adoredme--there have not been very many, but there have been some--havealways insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them,or they to care for me.  They have become stout and tedious, and when Imeet them, they go in at once for reminiscences.  That awful memory ofwoman!  What a fearful thing it is!  And what an utter intellectualstagnation it reveals!  One should absorb the colour of life, but oneshould never remember its details.  Details are always vulgar.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

"That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one whotranslates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and firewhich makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense canbear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as mostagreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of hisstyle, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in themore active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the moresedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulnessand perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglecteven the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the verycast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs ofantiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compassthan has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preservedeither the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to him is, tostudy his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, howlearned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of theworld; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all theancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, theArchbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of thespirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the EpicPoem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all, withwhatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happinesshe may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those onlywho have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning. For to satisfysuch a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a meremodern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing thatis not Greek.",The Iliad by Homer

Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,  O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!""  To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:(194)  ""Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride?  Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?  Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,  Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;  Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword  That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord.""  He said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng  Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;  The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;  The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.  Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,  Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.  ""Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest  In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:  Now hope no more those honours from thy train;  Go less than woman, in the form of man!  To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,  To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,  Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;  This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead.""",The Iliad by Homer
"My dear Dorian, it is quite true.  I am analysing women at present, soI ought to know.  The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was.I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plainand the coloured.  The plain women are very useful.  If you want togain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them downto supper.  The other women are very charming.  They commit onemistake, however.  They paint in order to try and look young.  Ourgrandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly.  _Rouge_ and_esprit_ used to go together.  That is all over now.  As long as a womancan look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectlysatisfied.  As for conversation, there are only five women in Londonworth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into decentsociety.  However, tell me about your genius.

"Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one ortwo words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epitheteinosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translatedliterally ""leaf-shaking,"" but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis:""the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods."" Others that admit ofdifferent significations, may receive an advantage from a judiciousvariation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced. Forexample, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or ""far-shooting,"" is capableof two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, theensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of thesun; therefore, in such places where Apollo is represented as a god inperson, I would use the former interpretation; and where the effects ofthe sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole,it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the sameepithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might beaccommodated (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is byno means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them,where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which theyare employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once showhis fancy and his judgment.",The Iliad by Homer

"The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed,considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt wouldbe gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its importance in aphilological view, I am inclined to set little store on its aestheticvalue, especially in poetry. Three parts of the emendations made uponpoets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been suggested to theauthor by his Maecenas or Africanus, he would probably have adopted.Moreover, those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbalcriticism and interpretation, are often least competent to carry out theirown precepts. Grammarians are not poets by profession, but may be so _peraccidens._ I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer,calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although amass of remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the historyof a thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would begloomy and jejune.",The Iliad by Homer

Would heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done,  The day that show'd me to the golden sun  Had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear  The fatal infant to the fowls of air?  Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide,  And midst the roarings of the waters died?  Heaven fill'd up all my ills, and I accursed  Bore all, and Paris of those ills the worst.

"This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of thesame epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the ""far-darting Phoebus,""the ""blue-eyed Pallas,"" the ""swift-footed Achilles,"" &c., which some havecensured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those of the godsdepended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; andhad contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotionsin which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it wasa matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was anirreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is ofopinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such;for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged toadd some other distinction of each person; either naming his parentsexpressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexanderthe son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c.Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used suchdistinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we havesomething parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of HaroldHarefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &c.If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for therepetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the worldinto its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen andthe iron one, of ""heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who foughtat Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiterin the islands of the blessed."" Now among the divine honours which werepaid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to bementioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might beacceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities.",The Iliad by Homer

So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood  Of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.

Far distant hence I held my wide command,  Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;  With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless'd,  A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;  With those I left whatever dear could be:  Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;  Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,  And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;  While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave  Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.  Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state,  Or one vast burst of all-involving fate  Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away  Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.  Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;  These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;  With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;  Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.""",The Iliad by Homer

Thestyle in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vividand obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technicalexpressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the workof some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle incolour.

Yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:  No more molest me on Atrides' part:  Is it for him these tears are taught to flow,  For him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?  A generous friendship no cold medium knows,  Burns with one love, with one resentment glows;  One should our interests and our passions be;  My friend must hate the man that injures me.  Do this, my Phoenix, 'tis a generous part;  And share my realms, my honours, and my heart.  Let these return: our voyage, or our stay,  Rest undetermined till the dawning day.""",The Iliad by Homer

You came--oh, mybeautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison.  You taught me whatreality really is.  To-night, for the first time in my life, I sawthrough the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant inwhich I had always played.  To-night, for the first time, I becameconscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that themoonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, andthat the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were notwhat I wanted to say.  You had brought me something higher, somethingof which all art is but a reflection.  You had made me understand whatlove really is.  My love!  My love!  Prince Charming!  Prince of life!I have grown sick of shadows.  You are more to me than all art can everbe.  What have I to do with the puppets of a play?  When I came onto-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gonefrom me.  I thought that I was going to be wonderful.  I found that Icould do nothing.  Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant.The knowledge was exquisite to me.  I heard them hissing, and I smiled.What could they know of love such as ours?  Take me away, Dorian--takeme away with you, where we can be quite alone.  I hate the stage.  Imight mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one thatburns me like fire.

"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recentlypublished, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of theHomeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no meansthe whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announcedby Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of theIliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body andunchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth centurybefore Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that nowritten copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during theearlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that withoutwriting, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could havebeen originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him,transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy andconvenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for longmanuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf'scase against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch,and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with theother seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has beenconsidered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate characterof the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems fromthe beginning.
To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf toPeisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, arenowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that viewof the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it, wewere driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninthcentury before the Christian aera. Few things, in my opinion, can be moreimprobable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfianhypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writingin Greece, even in the seventh century before the Christian aera, areexceedingly trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than thefortieth Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfullyexecuted; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonidesof Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac andlyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time thepractice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground whichauthorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in thefamous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at thePanathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts hadexisted, we are unable to say.",The Iliad by Homer

He has left us only the first book, and a small partof the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted thesense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account ofthe haste he was obliged to write in.

Not less their number than the embodied cranes,  Or milk-white swans in Asius' watery plains.  That, o'er the windings of Cayster's springs,(97)  Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,  Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,  Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.  Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,  The legions crowd Scamander's flowery side;(98)  With rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,  And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.  Along the river's level meads they stand,  Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,  Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,  The wandering nation of a summer's day:  That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,  In gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers;  From pail to pail with busy murmur run  The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.  So throng'd, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood  In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.  Each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins  In close array, and forms the deepening lines.  Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain  Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.  The king of kings, majestically tall,  Towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all;  Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads  His subject herds, the monarch of the meads,  Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,  His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;(99)  Jove o'er his eyes celestial glories spread,  And dawning conquest played around his head.",The Iliad by Homer

It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small anumber of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part isless in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist ofgeneral reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in anyperson's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have noapparent characters, so many of his speeches escape being applied andjudged by the rule of propriety.

"If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect ornarrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will befound upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times helived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods; and thevicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a wordof the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both bythe censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality toantiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,(38) ""that those times and mannersare so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours."" Whocan be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of thoseages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice ofrapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown butfor the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword,and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the otherside, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shockedat the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see theheroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of thatsimplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholdingmonarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, andprincesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought toreflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world;and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure inthe perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted withnations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almostthree thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertainingthemselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to befound, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alonetheir greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates theirdislike, will become a satisfaction.",The Iliad by Homer

"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion.  He used to wonder at theshallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thingsimple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.  To him, man was abeing with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiformcreature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought andpassion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladiesof the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-galleryof his country house and look at the various portraits of those whoseblood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip Herbert, described byFrancis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth andKing James, as one who was ""caressed by the Court for his handsomeface, which kept him not long company.""  Was it young Herbert's lifethat he sometimes led?  Had some strange poisonous germ crept from bodyto body till it had reached his own?  Was it some dim sense of thatruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that hadso changed his life?  Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelledsurcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.  What had thisman's legacy been?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed himsome inheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely thedreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here, from thefading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearlstomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand,and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.  Ona table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were largegreen rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life, andthe strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he somethingof her temperament in him?  These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed tolook curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby, with his powderedhair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face wassaturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted withdisdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands thatwere so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the eighteenthcentury, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.  What of thesecond Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in hiswildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curlsand insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?  The world hadlooked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at Carlton House.The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.  Beside him hung theportrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.  Her blood,also, stirred within him.  How curious it all seemed!  And his motherwith her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knewwhat he had got from her.  He had got from her his beauty, and hispassion for the beauty of others.  She laughed at him in her looseBacchante dress.  There were vine leaves in her hair.  The purplespilled from the cup she was holding.  The carnations of the paintinghad withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth andbrilliancy of colour.

"  ""Divine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,  And leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?  If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,  How shall thy friend, thy Phoenix, stay behind?  The royal Peleus, when from Pthia's coast  He sent thee early to the Achaian host;  Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd,  And new to perils of the direful field:  He bade me teach thee all the ways of war,  To shine in councils, and in camps to dare.  Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!  No time shall part us, and no fate divide,  Not though the god, that breathed my life, restore  The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,  When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames  (Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),  My father faithless to my mother's arms,  Old as he was, adored a stranger's charms.  I tried what youth could do (at her desire)  To win the damsel, and prevent my sire.  My sire with curses loads my hated head,  And cries, 'Ye furies! barren be his bed.'  Infernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,  And ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his vow.  Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!  Gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!  I thought (but some kind god that thought suppress'd)  To plunge the poniard in my father's breast;  Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain  With prayers entreat me, and with force detain.  On fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,  They daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;  Strong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire;  The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.  The tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:  And, favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall,  My travels thence through spacious Greece extend;  In Phthia's court at last my labours end.  Your sire received me, as his son caress'd,  With gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd.  The strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign,  And all the coast that runs along the main.  By love to thee his bounties I repaid,  And early wisdom to thy soul convey'd:  Great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:  A child I took thee, but a hero gave.  Thy infant breast a like affection show'd;  Still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)  Or at my knee, by Phoenix wouldst thou stand;  No food was grateful but from Phoenix' hand.(211)  I pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years,  The tender labours, the compliant cares,  The gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,  And Phoenix felt a father's joys in thee:  Thy growing virtues justified my cares,  And promised comfort to my silver hairs.  Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd;  A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:  The gods (the only great, and only wise)  Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;  Offending man their high compassion wins,  And daily prayers atone for daily sins.  Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race,  Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;  With humble mien, and with dejected eyes,  Constant they follow, where injustice flies.  Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,  Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,  While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.  Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove,  For him they mediate to the throne above  When man rejects the humble suit they make,  The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;  From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then  Descends to punish unrelenting men.  O let not headlong passion bear the sway  These reconciling goddesses obey  Due honours to the seed of Jove belong,  Due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.  Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,  Were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king;  Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage  Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.  But since what honour asks the general sends,  And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;  The best and noblest of the Grecian train;  Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!  Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,  A great example drawn from times of old;  Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,  Who conquer'd their revenge in former days.",The Iliad by Homer

A prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,  And points the crime, and thence derives the woes:  Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline  To avert the vengeance of the power divine;  Then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm'd;  Incensed he threaten'd, and his threats perform'd:  The fair Chryseis to her sire was sent,  With offer'd gifts to make the god relent;  But now he seized Briseis' heavenly charms,  And of my valour's prize defrauds my arms,  Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train;(63)  And service, faith, and justice, plead in vain.  But, goddess! thou thy suppliant son attend.  To high Olympus' shining court ascend,  Urge all the ties to former service owed,  And sue for vengeance to the thundering god.  Oft hast thou triumph'd in the glorious boast,  That thou stood'st forth of all the ethereal host,  When bold rebellion shook the realms above,  The undaunted guard of cloud-compelling Jove:  When the bright partner of his awful reign,  The warlike maid, and monarch of the main,  The traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,  Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven.  Then, call'd by thee, the monster Titan came  (Whom gods Briareus, men Ćgeon name),  Through wondering skies enormous stalk'd along;  Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong:  With giant-pride at Jove's high throne he stands,  And brandish'd round him all his hundred hands:  The affrighted gods confess'd their awful lord,  They dropp'd the fetters, trembled, and adored.(64)  This, goddess, this to his remembrance call,  Embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall;  Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train,  To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,  To heap the shores with copious death, and bring  The Greeks to know the curse of such a king.  Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head  O'er all his wide dominion of the dead,  And mourn in blood that e'er he durst disgrace  The boldest warrior of the Grecian race.""",The Iliad by Homer

Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,  And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,  Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,  And spent in empty air its erring force.  Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,  But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.  Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,  Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.

But, after all, themain fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand too great asacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals, andwhich are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has sought to robus of the name and existence of Homer, does too much violence to thatinward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admirationfor the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author of the Iliad a merecompiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevateanalytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of thesoul; and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus.

"I see you did.  Don't speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say.Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the mostextraordinary influence over me.  I was dominated, soul, brain, andpower, by you.  You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseenideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  Iworshipped you.  I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  Iwanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy when I was withyou.  When you were away from me, you were still present in my art....Of course, I never let you know anything about this.  It would havebeen impossible.  You would not have understood it.  I hardlyunderstood it myself.  I only knew that I had seen perfection face toface, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--toowonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the perilof losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....  Weeks andweeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.  Then came anew development.  I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and asAdonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned withheavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazingacross the green turbid Nile.  You had leaned over the still pool ofsome Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel ofyour own face.  And it had all been what art should be--unconscious,ideal, and remote.  One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, Idetermined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are,not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your owntime.  Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder ofyour own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist orveil, I cannot tell.  But I know that as I worked at it, every flakeand film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraidthat others would know of my idolatry.  I felt, Dorian, that I had toldtoo much, that I had put too much of myself into it.  Then it was thatI resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  You were alittle annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me.  But I did not mindthat.  When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I feltthat I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio,and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of itspresence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that Ihad seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-lookingand that I could paint.  Even now I cannot help feeling that it is amistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever reallyshown in the work one creates.  Art is always more abstract than wefancy.  Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  Itoften seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely thanit ever reveals him.  And so when I got this offer from Paris, Idetermined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.It never occurred to me that you would refuse.  I see now that you wereright.  The picture cannot be shown.  You must not be angry with me,Dorian, for what I have told you.  As I said to Harry, once, you aremade to be worshipped.",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

AfterI left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at thatlittle Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, andwent down at eight o'clock to the theatre.  Sibyl was playing Rosalind.Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd.  But Sibyl!You should have seen her!  When she came on in her boy's clothes, shewas perfectly wonderful.  She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin withcinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty littlegreen cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloaklined with dull red.

I forgot that I was in London and in thenineteenth century.  I was away with my love in a forest that no manhad ever seen.  After the performance was over, I went behind and spoketo her.  As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyesa look that I had never seen there before.  My lips moved towards hers.We kissed each other.  I can't describe to you what I felt at thatmoment.  It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to oneperfect point of rose-coloured joy.  She trembled all over and shooklike a white narcissus.  Then she flung herself on her knees and kissedmy hands.  I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't helpit.  Of course, our engagement is a dead secret.  She has not even toldher own mother.  I don't know what my guardians will say.  Lord Radleyis sure to be furious.  I don't care.  I shall be of age in less than ayear, and then I can do what I like.  I have been right, Basil, haven'tI, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare'splays?

Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait  Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.  So when the embattled clouds in dark array,  Along the skies their gloomy lines display;  When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,  And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:  The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,  Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;  Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,  Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.",The Iliad by Homer

The king amidst the mournful circle rose:  Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.  So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,  In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.

"I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it.After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.  Youfilled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.  For daysafter I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins.  As I loungedin the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every onewho passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives theyled.  Some of them fascinated me.  Others filled me with terror.  Therewas an exquisite poison in the air.  I had a passion for sensations....Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I determined to go out in searchof some adventure.  I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours,with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins,as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.  I fancieda thousand things.  The mere danger gave me a sense of delight.  Iremembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when wefirst dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secretof life.  I don't know what I expected, but I went out and wanderedeastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and blackgrassless squares.  About half-past eight I passed by an absurd littletheatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.  A hideousJew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, wasstanding at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.  He had greasyringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiledshirt. 'Have a box, my Lord?' he said, when he saw me, and he took offhis hat with an air of gorgeous servility.  There was something abouthim, Harry, that amused me.  He was such a monster.  You will laugh atme, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for thestage-box.

With these of old, to toils of battle bred,  In early youth my hardy days I led;  Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,  And smit with love of honourable deeds,  Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,  Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters' gore,  And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:  Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway'd;  When Nestor spoke, they listen'd and obey'd.  If in my youth, even these esteem'd me wise;  Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.  Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;  That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:  Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;  Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.  Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,  Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;  Him, awful majesty exalts above  The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.  Let both unite with well-consenting mind,  So shall authority with strength be join'd.  Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles' rage;  Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.  Forbid it, gods!

This day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame  Greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.  But darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,  And guards them trembling in their wooden walls.  Obey the night, and use her peaceful hours  Our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.  Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,  And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought  Wide o'er the field, high blazing to the sky,  Let numerous fires the absent sun supply,  The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,  Till the bright morn her purple beam displays;  Lest, in the silence and the shades of night,  Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.  Not unmolested let the wretches gain  Their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;  Some hostile wound let every dart bestow,  Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe,  Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses' care.  And warn their children from a Trojan war.  Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,  Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;  To bid the sires with hoary honours crown'd,  And beardless youths, our battlements surround.  Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,  And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;  Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,  The insidious foe the naked town invade.  Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;  A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.  The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector's hand  From these detested foes to free the land,  Who plough'd, with fates averse, the watery way:  For Trojan vultures a predestined prey.  Our common safety must be now the care;  But soon as morning paints the fields of air,  Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,  And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.  Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove  Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.  To-morrow's light (O haste the glorious morn!)  Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,  With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,  And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.  Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,  From age inglorious, and black death secure;  So might my life and glory know no bound,  Like Pallas worshipp'd, like the sun renown'd!

"If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the samepresiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts.Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principallyexcelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellenceof his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a paritywith those of the Scripture. Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, hascollected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with justice anexcellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughtsthat are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble;and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentimentswhere he is not fired by the Iliad.",The Iliad by Homer

"  ""Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,  O Atreus' son! canst thou indulge the rest?(78)  Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,  Directs in council, and in war presides,  To whom its safety a whole people owes,  To waste long nights in indolent repose.(79)  Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear;  Thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.  In just array draw forth the embattled train,  Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;  E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy  The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.  For now no more the gods with fate contend,  At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.  Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,  And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.  Awake, but waking this advice approve,  And trust the vision that descends from Jove.""",The Iliad by Homer

"There is no necessity, rejoined his companion.  ""Life has alwayspoppies in her hands.  Of course, now and then things linger.  I oncewore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artisticmourning for a romance that would not die.  Ultimately, however, it diddie.  I forget what killed it.  I think it was her proposing tosacrifice the whole world for me.  That is always a dreadful moment.It fills one with the terror of eternity.  Well--would you believeit?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinnernext the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the wholething again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future.  I hadburied my romance in a bed of asphodel.  She dragged it out again andassured me that I had spoiled her life.  I am bound to state that sheate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.  But what a lackof taste she showed!  The one charm of the past is that it is the past.But women never know when the curtain has fallen.  They always want asixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over,they propose to continue it.  If they were allowed their own way, everycomedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate ina farce.  They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense ofart.  You are more fortunate than I am.  I assure you, Dorian, that notone of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vanedid for you.  Ordinary women always console themselves.  Some of themdo it by going in for sentimental colours.  Never trust a woman whowears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five whois fond of pink ribbons.  It always means that they have a history.Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the goodqualities of their husbands.  They flaunt their conjugal felicity inone's face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.  Religionconsoles some.  Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, awoman once told me, and I can quite understand it.  Besides, nothingmakes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.  Conscience makesegotists of us all.  Yes; there is really no end to the consolationsthat women find in modern life.  Indeed, I have not mentioned the mostimportant one.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde

Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Dobats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question,it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozingoff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand withDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upona heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll
